During the Java Learning process or during Java coding interview preparation we come across some tricky topic for which we often need to test the code for really learn the topic by doing it. 
So this code repository actually tries to encompass all such tricky code scenarios. 
e.g. When we learn about iterating HashMap if we will not practice it ourselves then we tend to forget the concepts. 
similarly we try learning various scenarios in SimpleDateFormat and we want to try it out in Code Editor.

So in this codebase, I have tried to put all my learnings.
Perhaps it might be useful for someone else.

Happy Coding!
